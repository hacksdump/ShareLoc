# ShareLoc

## About

ShareLoc is a simple file sharing app built for local network.

How many times has it happened that we need to urgently send a file to a friend only to discover the most obscure means to do so?

ShareLoc displays you the list of your friends using ShareLoc and connected to the same Wifi as you.

Simply click on their IP address and you are good to go.
